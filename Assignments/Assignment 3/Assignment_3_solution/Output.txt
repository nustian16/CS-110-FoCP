(2). Assignment Explanation: -
		In this assignment we have created 5 functions for the proper working of this program:
		1st function counts the total number of digits of given number.
		2nd This function takes input from user and calculate the mode that many times because
		mod will give the nth digit from right.
		3rd function is similar to 2nd function but it tell of positon of nth digit from
		the left of the number.
		4th function uses previous function to get the nth digit and increment the number 
		in array at position of that digit
		5th function uses third function to get the nth digit of given array then it will 
		compare with the return array if the digit match then return array will be increment
		by one at that position.
(3). Pattern of Numbers: -
		0s:	5136 (55%)
		1s:	499 (5%)
		2s:	446 (4%)
		3s:	457 (4%)
		4s:	446 (4%)
		5s:	482 (5%)
		6s:	469 (5%)
		7s:	462 (4%)
		8s:	441 (4%)
		9s:	439 (4%)
(4). Outlining pattern Law: -
		This program gives the output by accepting numbers from the array and give frequencies
		of numbers from 0-9 at the positions given by user.
