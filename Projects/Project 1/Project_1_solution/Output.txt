Brief Explanation: -
		This is soltaire encryption algorithm in which we have to generate keystream by performing 
		five steps. In first we have to swap joker A(27) with next number. Secondly we have to swap 
		joker B(28) with next to numbers. Thirdly we have to find first joker in the given shuffling 
		of deck and then we have to put the numbers below first jack above the second jack and the 
		numbers above second jack below the first jack. Fourthly we have the check the last number
		and have to put that many number before the last number. Fifthly we have to check the first 
		number and have to pick the number next to the value of first number.
		In task 2: We have to perform these steps corresponding to each letter. And using arithmatic
		information we have to encode the given message.
		In task 3: We have to use the same keystream generated for encrytption and then by performing
		arithmetic calculations we have to generate the orignal message(Decrypt the message.)

Difficulties:
		Step 3 was the difficul task for us. We ask our fellows to let us understand the logic of 
		step 3. With our good approach we understood that we have to make temporary arrays.
