CLASS:           BSCS-6-A.
PROJECT:         03 (RSA ENCRYPTION).
********************* BRIEF EXPLANATION: *********************
In this project we have first encrypted the inputted message by
applying methods of generating keystream. 
And after encryption we have also made it to decrypt that 
encrypted message separately.
This project is very similar to the previous one of 
the CYPHER CAESAR.
********************* DIFFICULTIES FACED: *********************
It was difficult for us to generate the power of a larger number
and then taking the mode of that number.
But by searching the techniques to make it possible, on the internet
we successfully completed our project.
********************* COMMENTS/SUGGESTIONS: ********************* 
This project was good as it helps us to encode our message to 
ununderstandable form so that we can share it on internet in this
technical era.
