Brief Explanation: 
			In this project we have to made two functions one is ecrypt while the other is 
			decrypt. Encrypt function shifts every alphabet in the given string k (1-25) 
			times forward and generate the encrypted string. Decrypt function shifts every
			alphabet of encrypted function k times backword to generate the orignal string.
Difficulties faced:
			Dealing with ASCII for the alphabets was little bit trick and exhausted me alot.
